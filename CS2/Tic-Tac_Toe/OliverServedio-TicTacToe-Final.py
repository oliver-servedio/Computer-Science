Description: A game of tic tac toe either against a bot or player
Bugs: None
Features: uses a list instead of array for more efficient code
Sources: Mr. Campbell and W3Schools
Log: 1.0 initial version 
Note: I had trouble getting the exit function to work how I wanted because it was initially inside a function so I used the return 1's to get it to work
