Fellow Americans election only most important our lives It 
one most important life our nation   
  
many ways Donald Trump unserious man  
  
consequences putting Donald Trump back White House 
extremely serious  
  
Consider only chaos calamity office also 
gravity what happened since lost last election   
Donald Trump tried throw away your votes   
  
he failed sent armed mob United States Capitol where 
assaulted law enforcement officers   
  
politicians own party begged him call off mob send help 
he did opposite \fanned flames  
now entirely different set crimes found guilty fraud by 
jury everyday Americans separately found liable committing sexual 
abuse  
consider what intends do if give him power again   
Consider explicit intent set free violent extremists assaulted those 
law enforcement officers at Capitol  
His explicit intent jail journalists Political opponents Anyone sees 
enemy   
His explicit intent deploy our active duty military against our own citizens  
  
Consider power  especially after United States Supreme 
Court just ruled immune from criminal prosecution   
  
imagine Donald Trump no guardrails How use immense 
powers presidency United States Not improve your life Not 
strengthen our national security  
  serve only client ever had Himself   
And what second Trump term look like Its laid out 
Project  Written by closest advisors its sum total pull our 
country back into past  
  
America going back  
  
We going back Donald Trump tried cut Social Security 
Medicare going back tried get rid Affordable 
Care Act   
  
When insurance companies could deny people pre existing conditions  
  
We going let him eliminate Department Education funds 
our public schools going let him end programs like Head Start 
provide preschool child care  
America going back charting New Way Forward   
Forward future strong growing middle class  
  
strong middle class always been critical Americas 
success building middle class defining goal presidency  
personal me middle class where come from mother kept 
strict budget lived within our means Yet wanted little   
  
she expected us make most opportunities were available 
us grateful them Because opportunity available everyone   
  
Thats why create what call opportunity economy opportunity 
economy where everyone chance compete chance succeed 
Whether you live rural area small town or big city  
President bring together Labor workers Small business owners 
entrepreneurs American companies  
create jobs Grow our economy lower cost everyday needs Like 
health care Housing groceries  
We Provide access capital small business owners entrepreneurs 
founders end Americas housing shortage protect Social Security 
Medicare  
  
Compare Donald Trump \\doesnt actually fight middle class 
Instead fights himself billionaire friends give them 
another round tax breaks add  trillion dollars national debt  All while intends enact what effect national sales tax call 
Trump tax  raise prices middle class families by almost  
thousand dollars year   
instead  Trump tax hike pass middle class tax cut 
benefit more than  million Americans  
  
Friends believe America cannot truly prosperous unless Americans fully 
able make own decisions about own lives Especially matters  
heart home   
  
tonight too many women America able make those decisions 
Lets clear about how got here  
Donald Trump hand picked members United States Supreme Court take 
away reproductive freedom now brags about His words Quote did 
Im proud done End quote  
Over past two years traveled across our country women told 
me stories Husbands fathers shared theirs Stories Women 
miscarrying parking lotGetting sepsisLosing ability ever 
children again  
  
All because doctors afraid going jail caring patients
